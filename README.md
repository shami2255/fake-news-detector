# fake-news-detector
A machine learning-based fake news detection system using ensemble methods (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) and TF-IDF text vectorization.  Built with a Flask web app for easy, real-time news verification.
his project is a Fake News Detector that uses machine learning algorithms and ensemble techniques to classify news articles as real or fake. It combines multiple classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) into a voting ensemble to improve prediction accuracy.

The project also features a Flask web application that allows users to input news text and instantly get a prediction, making it practical and user-friendly. It leverages TF-IDF vectorization for converting text data into numerical features suitable for model training.

Ideal for anyone interested in natural language processing, machine learning, and web deployment.
